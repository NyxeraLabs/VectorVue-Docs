# Phase 4 Sprint 4.1 - Field-Level Encryption

## Threat Model
- Asset: evidence payload blobs stored in compliance event records and export pipelines.
- Adversary: database snapshot thief, lateral internal reader, key exfiltration attacker.
- Trust boundary: evidence serialization path at write/read in evidence engine.

## Attack Vectors Considered
- Raw evidence blob disclosure from DB backups.
- Cross-tenant decryption attempts.
- Root key compromise blast radius across tenants.

## Mitigations Implemented
- Added envelope encryption for evidence blobs (`vv-evidence-env-v1`).
- Data encrypted with per-record DEK (`AES-256-GCM`).
- DEK wrapped with tenant-derived KEK (HKDF-SHA256 over HSM root key + tenant ID).
- Tenant-bound AAD enforces decryption context integrity.
- Evidence export path decrypts only when tenant context matches envelope tenant.

## Residual Risk
- Current HSM provider bootstrap can be configured via environment JSON for dev/CI compatibility.
- Production operations must source root keys from true HSM-backed secret distribution.

## Future Improvements
- Replace bootstrap provider with cloud/HSM-native key handle integration.
- Add key-rotation metadata table and automated rewrap workflow.
