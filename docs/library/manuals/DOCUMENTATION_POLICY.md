# VectorVue Documentation Policy

## 1. Purpose

VectorVue documentation must support enterprise and regulated commercial usage.

Primary goals:

- reduce operator and client confusion
- provide step-by-step operational clarity
- preserve technical and legal accuracy
- maintain a professional product narrative

## 2. Required Standards

- Role-first structure: organize by operator, client, auditor, platform engineer.
- Task-first writing: provide explicit steps and expected outcomes.
- Production tone: concise, factual, and implementation-ready.
- Tenant safety: always state scope and isolation constraints where relevant.
- Version clarity: include relevant product version/date context.

## 3. Naming Guidance

- Avoid phase-heavy language in user-facing manuals.
- Use outcome-oriented names: "Client Analytics", "Auditor Guide", "Operator Manual".
- Internal roadmap may keep phase references for engineering planning.

## 4. Legal and Header Requirement

All new project files must include a license header aligned with repository policy.

Use:

```text
<!-- Copyright (c) 2026 NyxeraLabs | Author: José María Micoli | Licensed under BSL 1.1 | Change Date: 2033-02-17 → Apache-2.0 -->
```

## 5. Update Rules

- When modifying a major workflow, update the corresponding manual in the same change.
- Keep cross-references current from `README.md` and `docs/manuals/INDEX.md`.
- Remove outdated statements that conflict with current deployment or feature behavior.
