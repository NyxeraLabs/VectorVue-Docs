# VectorVue Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 2026-01-01

This Privacy Policy describes how VectorVue handles data in both self-hosted and future SaaS deployment models.

---

# 1. Scope

This policy applies to:

- Self-hosted installations of VectorVue
- Future managed SaaS offerings
- Official VectorVue services operated by NyxeraLabs

It does not apply to third-party infrastructure controlled by operators.

---

# 2. Deployment Models

## 2.1 Self-Hosted Version

In self-hosted deployments:

- NyxeraLabs does NOT collect operational data by default.
- All logs, credentials, and audit trails remain under operator control.
- No telemetry is transmitted externally unless explicitly enabled.

The operator is solely responsible for:

- Data protection compliance
- Secure storage
- Regulatory obligations

## 2.2 Future SaaS Version

In SaaS deployments, VectorVue may process:

- Account identifiers
- Authentication logs
- Role and access metadata
- Operational audit logs
- Platform usage telemetry
- Abuse detection signals

Sensitive operational artifacts remain tenant-isolated.

---

# 3. Data Categories

VectorVue may handle the following categories of data:

### 3.1 Account Data
- Usernames
- Email addresses
- Role assignments
- Authentication credentials (hashed)

### 3.2 Operational Metadata
- Execution timestamps
- Workflow actions
- Audit events
- Approval records

### 3.3 Security Data
- Access attempts
- Privilege escalations
- Integrity validation events
- API usage logs

VectorVue is not designed to collect personal data beyond what is required for secure account management.

---

# 4. Purpose of Processing

Data is processed for:

- Authentication and access control
- Platform integrity
- Abuse prevention
- Audit traceability
- Regulatory compliance
- Security monitoring

Data is not used for advertising or profiling.

---

# 5. Data Retention

Retention policies depend on deployment model:

- Self-hosted: defined and enforced by the operator.
- SaaS: defined by service agreement and regulatory requirements.

Audit logs may require extended retention for compliance purposes.

---

# 6. Data Security

VectorVue enforces:

- Encryption in transit (TLS)
- Encryption at rest (where configured)
- Role-based access control
- Immutable logging mechanisms

Operators must ensure infrastructure-level security controls.

---

# 7. Data Sharing

NyxeraLabs does not sell personal data.

Data may be disclosed only:

- To comply with legal obligations
- To prevent fraud or abuse
- Under explicit contractual agreement (SaaS enterprise context)

---

# 8. International Data Transfers (Future SaaS)

If SaaS is deployed internationally:

- Appropriate safeguards will be implemented
- Regulatory transfer mechanisms will be defined in service agreements

---

# 9. User Rights (SaaS Context)

Where applicable under law, users may have the right to:

- Access their personal data
- Request correction
- Request deletion
- Restrict processing
- Object to certain processing activities

Self-hosted deployments are governed by the operator’s own data policies.

---

# 10. Children’s Data

VectorVue is not intended for use by individuals under 18 years of age.

---

# 11. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect:

- Platform evolution
- Regulatory changes
- SaaS deployment expansion

Material changes will be communicated where applicable.
